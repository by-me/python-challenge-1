1. ## Overview

This project implements an interactive ordering system for a food truck. Customers can select items from a categorized menu, specify quantities, and receive a detailed receipt with the total cost of their order. The system is built using Python, demonstrating key programming concepts such as dictionaries, lists, input validation, loops, and formatted output.

2. ## Features
- **Categorized Menu**: Items are organized into Snacks, Meals, Drinks, and Desserts.
- **User Interaction**: Customers can select items by number and specify quantities.
- **Input Validation**: The system checks for valid inputs for menu selections and quantities.
- **Order Summary**: Receives a formatted receipt displaying item names, prices, quantities, and total cost.

3. ## Code Structure
- **Menu**: A nested dictionary that stores the categories, subcategories, and prices of the items available for order.
- **Order** List: The order is maintained in a list of dictionaries, each containing the item name, price, and quantity.
- **Receipt Display**: A well-structured receipt is generated that aligns the item names, prices, and quantities into neat columns.

4. ## Project Resources and Acknowledgments
* **Class Material** : All concepts and techniques used to build the ordering system were studied in the course, including how to work with -
ictionaries, loops, and input validation.
* **Menu Support File:** The menu dictionary, provided as a support file during the course, was used as the primary dataset for the project.
* **ChatGPT Assistance:** As an experienced data scientist, I used ChatGPT for help with syntax corrections and general optimizations. While the logic and structure of the project were independently developed, ChatGPT provided additional support to ensure clean and efficient code.

5. ## Conclusion
This Food Truck Ordering System project demonstrates practical applications of Python programming concepts like data structures, loops, and input validation. It satisfies all challenge requirements and delivers a functional, user-friendly ordering system.
